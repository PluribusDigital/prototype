# prototype
Template Project for Rapid Prototype Creation - Rails, Angular.js, Cucumber, CoffeeScript, Sass

# run things
(It is often smoothest to prefix all of these with `bundle exec`)
`cucumber` to run through-the-browser full stack acceptance tests
`rspec`    to run rails API specs (model & controller tests)
`teaspoon` to run angular javascript unit tests

# credit where credit is due
This application is based on the [angular rails project](http://angular-rails.com/). There are a couple of tweaks, like using cucumber, but you can get up to speed on the what and why the sample code is doing by reviewing the great tutorial there.
